The Guerilla Mindfulness Front is an anonymous group of pragmatic realists who 
want to improve the world around them by reducing suffering.

We believe that much of the suffering and conflict in daily lives is driven 
from people not understanding their own inner selves and motivations. While 
complete and "true" facts about the self may be difficult to know, it is still 
possible to improve conscious awareness.

With the goal of raising awareness, not just in the generic activist sense, 
but with the deeper intent of forcing people to look inwards, the GMF releases 
tools, guerilla art, and absurd experiments.

**The tools, flyers, cards, and other associated material on this site are 
designed to let *you* print them out and use them. THIS IS IMPORTANT. You can 
help.**

Currently, the flyers and other content are targetted at the cultural 
situation in the United States. However, we would love if the idea spreads to 
other places and changes along the way.

We're just getting started.

Prepare your brain juices.
