# Flyers

Printing the black and white flyers is straightforward. If you use the "TAKE A 
BREATH" variants with the tear-off strips, just cut between them. Obviously.

If placing in outdoor areas, you should use a laser printer or a copier, 
because inkjet pages will run in the rain. (You could also laminate flyers for
longevity in places you know they will stay up, but that is an expensive option.)

There are two non-destructive modes for outdoor mounting: Staples (to wooden 
telephone poles) and packing tape (everything else). Staple guns make the first 
part easier (buy long staples), and tape guns make the second part easier.

Where to put them, you ask? On kiosks, flyer walls, bulletin boards, with band 
posters, wherever people might see them.


# Cards

These can be printed on cardstock if your printer has a manual feed, or on 
business card templates, or on plain paper and then laminated.

2-sided printing with consumer-level printers is tricky. Most printers will 
align each page slightly differently, so don't worry about getting it exact.

For most cards, we attempt to provide a PDF from the base SVG which allows for 
duplexed printing on printers which support that. This should theoretically 
cause the alignment to work better.

You can introduce cards according to the rules on them, or leave them in
interesting places. They're business card sized for a reason - they fit in
business card places, they fit in credit card slots in ATMs and public credit 
card machines, and so on. Don't jam them in anything that's going to break!
